            <p className="about-text">Hi, i'm Ben, an aspiring Front-End Web Developer based in the UK.</p>
            <p className="about-text">I began to code in 2021 and started with languages such as HTML, CSS and Javascript. Since learning to code, I have always enjoyed the process of problem solving and the feeling of achievement when you manage to solve the outcome you were working towards.</p>
            <p className="about-text">Looking back prior to when I started to code, I believe having the experience of creating formulas within Excel and coding VBA Macros gave myself a better understanding of what is required to learn Javascript etc.</p>
            <p className="about-text">Feel free to head over to the Projects section to see the sites I have made so far!</p>
